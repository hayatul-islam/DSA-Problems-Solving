// Remove First and Last Character
// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str) {
  let char = "";
  for (let i = 1; i < str.length - 1; i++) {
    char += str[i];
  }
  return char;
}

function removeChar2(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}

console.log(removeChar("Hello world"));
